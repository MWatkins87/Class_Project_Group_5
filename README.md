### Executive Summary

**Introduction to the Analysis of Real Estate Price Trends**

Navigating the recent surge in housing prices represents one of the most significant challenges in the American real estate landscape. Conventional wisdom, supported by numerous studies, suggests that this increase is primarily driven by internal migration and a stagnant housing supply.

Contrary to expectations, regions experiencing population declines have not seen corresponding decreases in housing prices, suggesting that factors other than simple supply and demand dynamics are at play. This study aims to explore alternative factors that might be influencing these price trends.

Our analysis focuses on ten cities, chosen to represent both booming and sluggish housing markets based on recent performance metrics. The cities include Atlanta, Miami, Detroit, Tampa, and Las Vegas, which have shown strong market growth, and Baltimore, New Orleans, Washington D.C., San Francisco, and Portland, where the markets have been less robust.

We examined a range of data from 2012 to 2022 for these cities, considering variables such as population growth, homelessness, crime rates, college tuition costs, and mortgage rates. The objective is to identify both positive and negative correlations that could explain the divergent trends in housing prices across these different environments.
